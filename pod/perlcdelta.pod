=head1 Modules and Pragmata

=head2 Updated Modules and Pragmata

=over 4

=item L<Archive::Tar> 2.32

Fix absolute path handling on VMS.

Skip white_space test on MSWin32 as Windows will report that both
  files exist, which is obviously a 'feature'

fix creating file with trailing whitespace on filename - fixes 103279

allow archiving with absolute pathnames - fixes 97748

Speed up extract when archive contains lots of files

CVE-2018-12015 directory traversal vulnerability [RT#125523]

=item L<Compress::Raw::Bzip2> 2.081

pgcc support

=item L<Compress::Raw::Zlib> 2.081

keep our pgcc support,

=item L<Cpanel::JSON::XS>  4.06

Added json_type support, ...

=item L<Cwd> 4.75c

Fixed long pathnames test for getcwd() on older systems, like
debian-7.11 i386, which still returns ENAMETOOLONG on large enough
buffers.

Fix the HAS_GET_CURRENT_DIR_NAME check, and the is_ENAMETOOLONG macro.

For getcwd with C<get_current_dir_name()> - i.e. fastcwd - add
abs_path.  See also L<http://perl11.org/blog/fastcwd.html>

=item L<Data::Dumper>  2.172

Restore deparsing support in the XS dumper, on Perl 5.18 and earlier.

Fix bug when dumping globs with quoting (which now happens for
all Unicode glob names)

Behavior change: C<$dumper->Useqq(undef)> is now treated as setting the
"useqq" option, not getting it (and similarly for other options)
L<[perl #113090]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=113090>

Quote glob names better; notably, Unicode globs are
now handled correctly.

Document the MacOS build failures & how MacPort can work around the issue.
RT #125238, RT #125585, RT #133280

Write all test db files into a directory created by File::Temp
Protects against any possible races if running a parallel build.

no strict hashpairs in encoding.
fixed some -Wsign-compare
See L<https://metacpan.org/changes/distribution/Encode>

(since 5.6)

Stop directory tweaking C<$Encode::Encoding{utf8}>

Fix gcc warnings for older gcc < 4.0

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<cperlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If you think it's a cperl specific bug or trust the cperl developers more 
please file an issue at L<https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues>.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
For details of how to report the issue.
