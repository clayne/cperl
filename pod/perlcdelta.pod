=item *

Fixed missing compile-time AvSHAPED detection in nested scopes.
E.g.:

    my @a[1]; sub { $a[0]->[5] = 1 }->(); # mderef_u
    my @b[1]; sub { $b[0] = 1 }->();      # aelemfast_lex_u

See L<[cperl #354]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/354>.

=item *

The C<readpipe()> built-in function now checks at compile time that it has only
one parameter expression, and puts it in scalar context, thus ensuring that it
doesn't corrupt the stack at runtime.
L<[perl #4574]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=4574>

=item *

C<re_intuit_start()> was fixed for non-utf8 targets to ignore the utf8 folding rules.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<cperlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If you think it's a cperl specific bug or trust the cperl developers more 
please file an issue at L<https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues>.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
For details of how to report the issue.
